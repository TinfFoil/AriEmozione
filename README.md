## Information on Subfolders


1. Subfolder crossvalidation <br />
`This folder contains all the models that performs 10-fold cross validation on the merged train set and development set (which is also called cv set)` <br />
2. Subfolder datasets <br />
`This folder contains all datasets that are used in this project. We have a train set (ariaset_train.tsv), a development set (ariaset_dev.tsv), and a test set (ariaset_test.tsv)` <br />
3. Subfolder test<br />
`This folder contains all the models that are trained using cv set and tested on test set`
4. Subfolder .idea
`I don't know what does this do. @Francesco, what does this folder do?`

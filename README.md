# Aria-classification
==================================
Opera Arie Project (Draft)
==================================

Baseline -> tf-idf 

Approaches to be tested (incomplete)
1) Topic Modeling (LSA / LDiA) 
2) k-Nearest Neighbours (maybe?)
3) Google's Word2Vec
	3.1) Preprocessing options to include rare words:
		-Regex to substitute rare words
		-Stemming/Lemmatization
4) Recurrent Neural Networks (if we want to consider what's been previously said -context-)

# AriEmozione:  Identifying Emotions in Opera Verses

The main task of our project was to identify  the  emotion  expressed  in  a  verse,  in the context of an aria.


## Information on Subfolders


1. Subfolder crossvalidation <br />
`This folder contains all the models that perform 10-fold cross validation using the cv dataset and tested on the dev dataset` <br />

2. Subfolder test<br />
`This folder contains all the models that are trained on the merged cv and dev dataset (ariaset_train.tsv + ariaset_dev.tsv) and tested on the test set`

Further indications about how to download the corpus and run the tests can be found in each subfolder.


## Data and Experiments
